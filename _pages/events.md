<p style='text-align: justify;'>Over the last decade, I have co-organized a number of academic events. Among them, two prominent series are the Sciences Po Summer workshop in sustainable finance (end June) and the FirmOrgDyn reasearch conference, co-sponsored by Banque de France, Banca d'Italia, Sciences Po, EIEF and in association with the CEPR (early December).
